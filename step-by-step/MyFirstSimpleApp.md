## Space Spheres

### description

This exercise will guide you through importing a geometry into Unity and creating a simple app with the available physics components. It will also focus on the basics of rendering including lights, materials and post-processing effects.

* #### step 1 - import geometry
Create a new folder in your Assets named "3D models". This is where we will save all imported geometries. Drag and drop your desired 3D model inside the folder. Unity can import 3D geometry in a number of different [file formats](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/3D-formats.html), we will be importing an fbx file for this exercise as it is one of the most common ones. 

As soon as you import the geometry file, you will see that Unity automatically creates a prefab asset that holds all the relevant information for it. If you click on the asset you will see in your inspector the model [import settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/FBXImporter-Model.html).
