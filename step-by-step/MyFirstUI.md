## User interaction through UI buttons

### description

In this exercise we will have a look into unityâ€™s UI elements and how we can create User Intefaces. More specifically we will create two buttons that will activate two different functionalities. The first button will take the random cubes and position them onto grid defined positions. The second button will trigger the reshuffling method we wrote in the previous exercise.
