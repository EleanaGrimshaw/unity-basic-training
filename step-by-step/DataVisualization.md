## Interactive Building Data

### description

This exercise will guide you through creating a city based Data visualization app. The building 3D geometries will be imported in Unity and their corresponding data will be read from a csv file. You will then learn how to create data holding classes in order to store the incoming building information and query them at any time during gametime. Finally you will create a user interface that binds everything together and provides an interactive app with layers and object information.
