## what is Unity?
Unity is a cross-platform game engine created by Unity Technologies. It can be used to create both 2D and 3D games, as well as, simulations, immersive experiences and a variety of other apps. Although it is originally a tool to make games it is being used in a variety of other industries including film, engineering, architecture and construction.

## getting started
1. **[User Interface](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html)**
The first time you open Unity there is a list of things you need to look into. The first step will be to familiarize yourself with the user interface and more specifically what are the components that constitute it. Make sure you understand your distinct workspaces: the [project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html), the [hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html), the [inspector window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html), as well as the [scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html) and the [game view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html).
